# gallery

promina assessment

the app start (AppStartPointWidget) by checking is user login or not then return the right view

there are 2 main Features (Authentication , PhotosGallery) which are managed by (authRepo,galleryRepo);

there are 2 main view (LoginView) , (GalleryView) managed by (Auth cubit) , (gallery cubit);

PLEASE NOTE :
- i don't have tablet or iphone to test on them so it may not be responsive on tablet
i could setup project with sizer to adapt with different screens but still i have to test on real tablet device
- api is public (should add it to .env);
